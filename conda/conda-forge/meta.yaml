  # If the installation is complex, or different between Unix and
  # Windows, use separate bld.bat and build.sh files instead of this
  # key.  By default, the package will be built for the Python
  # versions supported by conda-forge and for all major OSs.  Add the
  # line "skip: True # [py<35]" (for example) to limit to Python 3.5
  # and newer, or "skip: True # [not win]" to limit to Windows.
