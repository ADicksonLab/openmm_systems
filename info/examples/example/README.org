* This is an example

You'll find the inputs in the ~input~ folder the source code scripts
in the ~source~ directory and the outputs from the scripts will be put
into the ~_output~ directory. Any tangled sources from this README
should go into the ~tangle_source~ folder.

Here any command line parameters or descriptions of the inputs and
outputs should be made. Any code in the README should get tested.
