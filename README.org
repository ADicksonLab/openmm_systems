* OpenMM-Systems

Premade molecular systems for use with [[http://openmm.org/][OpenMM]].

This code was copied from the [[https://github.com/choderalab/openmmtools][OpenMMTools]] project. That project is
very useful, but sometimes unreliable to install on all
platforms. Most of our projects simply make use of the test systems so
we decided to have them installable by themselves.

** Docs and Info

See the [[file:./info][info]] directory for the documentation and history of the
project. The [[file:./info/README.org][README]] serves as an index. These files are (mostly) in
emacs org-mode and serve as the primary source of documentation. 

** Developing

See the [[file:info/dev_guide.org][Developers Guide]] for developing.
